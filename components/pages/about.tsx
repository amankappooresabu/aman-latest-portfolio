        I&apos;m a software engineer passionate about building thoughtful, reliable,
        and scalable software. Currently gaining real-world experience as an SDE Intern at Oronium,
        where I get to solve meaningful problems every day. I hold a B.Tech in
        Computer Science Engineering from SJCET Palai, graduated in 2025, which
        gave me a strong foundation in both the theory and practice of software
        development.
